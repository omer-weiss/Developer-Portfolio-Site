Omer-Weiss-Dev-Portfolio

Description

My goal in working on this project was to create a portfolio that will let employers view samples of my work, learn basic information about me and have access to contact information if they have the desire to reach out to me. This process involved learning and implementing basic and advanced css tools like flex box, media query and inline blocks as well as working with the html code to enable nav bar links, image links, and adjusting certain elements to be bigger in size than the rest of the elements on the page. 

Installation

I created a new repo on github, cloned to my local machine and began adding html and css code code to the files located in the repo, which I created after the cloning of the repo. Throughout this process I have made "git commit" messages to ensure proper workflow.
